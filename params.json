{"name":"Cosmonest","tagline":"Cosmological Nested Sampling (to be used with cosmomc)","body":"Cosmonest is an algorithm for calculating the model likelihood (or \"Evidence\") in a Bayesian framework. It is based on an original concept by John Skilling.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm and its implementation, together with some applications for Cosmological Model Selection, are described in the following papers:\r\n* \"A Nested Sampling Algorithm for Cosmological Model Selection\", Mukherjee, Parkinson & Liddle, ApJ (2006), astro-ph/0508461\r\n* \"Model selection as a science driver for dark energy surveys\", Mukherjee, Parkinson, Corasaniti, Liddle & Kunz, MNRAS (2006), astro-ph/0512484\r\n* \"A Bayesian model selection analysis of WMAP3\", Parkinson, Mukherjee & Liddle, PRD, in press (2006), astro-ph/0605003\r\n* \"Model selection forecasts for the spectral index from the Planck satellite\", Pahud, Liddle, Mukherjee & David Parkinson, PRD, in press (2006), astro-ph/0605004\r\n\r\nSee the ReadMe file for program documentation and download.\r\n\r\nIf you use this software, please reference the first and third papers above.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
